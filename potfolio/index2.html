                <br>
                <p>

                    This project is a full-featured clone of Myntra, showcasing a user-friendly, responsive e-commerce interface. Built with a focus on both aesthetics and functionality, the clone replicates Myntra‚Äôs design and core features, such as product listings, filtering options, and a streamlined shopping experience. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I aimed to recreate the visual appeal and usability of a modern e-commerce site, ensuring compatibility across devices. This project not only demonstrates my skills in front-end development but also my attention to detail in emulating a popular, real-world application.</p>

                <br>
                <p>"I have developed a clone of UltraEdit, one of the most powerful text editors, with the aim of recreating its seamless experience for developers. This project focuses on replicating key features such as multi-caret editing, syntax highlighting, and customizable themes, all while maintaining an intuitive interface. With careful attention to detail, the clone offers robust functionality for coding, text manipulation, and file management. Whether you're editing code or plain text, the UltraEdit clone ensures efficiency and precision, making it a versatile tool for developers.
